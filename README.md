### Modularized Feedback System for SOPHIE (Standardized Online Patient for Healthcare Interaction Education)

**Overview:**
SOPHIE Feedback is an integral component of the SOPHIE project, designed to enhance medical education. The SOPHIE project utilizes large language models and high-fidelity human avatars, aiming to train medical students in sensitive areas such as end-of-life conversations.

**Current Version:**
For an overview of the most recent version of the SOPHIE project, please visit: [SOPHIE Project - ROC-HCI](https://roc-hci.com/current-projects/voice/).

**Functionality:**
The SOPHIE Feedback system is a specialized component of the SOPHIE project, focusing on the post-processing and delivery of feedback:

- **Preprocessing Phases:**
  - **Simulation and Training:** Users interact with an AI-driven bot, simulating end-of-life conversations. This realistic practice is essential for developing the skills needed in delicate medical scenarios.
  - **Skill Assessment and Feedback:** Each sentence spoken by the user is analyzed and tagged with relevant communication skills. This analysis serves as the basis for feedback.

- **Feedback Delivery:**
  Once the preprocessing phases are complete, the SOPHIE Feedback system takes over to efficiently deliver the results:
  1. **Interactive Flask Webpage:** This output provides an interactive overview of the user's performance, highlighting areas of strength and those needing improvement.
  2. **Detailed PDF Report:** The system generates a comprehensive PDF report detailing the user's conversational skills, with specific feedback tailored to their performance.

*The SOPHIE project is a research initiative developed within the University of Rochester's ROC-HCI Lab.*
