### Modularized Feedback System for SOPHIE (Standardized Online Patient for Healthcare Interaction Education)

**Overview:**
SOPHIE Feedback is an integral component of the SOPHIE project, designed to enhance medical education. The SOPHIE project utilizes large language models and high-fidelity human avatars, aiming to train medical students in sensitive areas such as end-of-life conversations.

**Current Version:**
For an overview of the most recent version of the SOPHIE project, please visit: [SOPHIE Project - ROC-HCI](https://roc-hci.com/current-projects/voice/).

**Functionality:**
The SOPHIE Feedback system is a specialized component of the SOPHIE project, focusing on the post-processing and delivery of feedback:

- **Preprocessing Phases:**
  - **Simulation and Training:** Users interact with an AI-driven bot for simulating end-of-life conversations. This phase, essential for skill development in delicate medical scenarios, is managed by the SOPHIE project but not directly by the SOPHIE Feedback system.
  - **Skill Assessment and Feedback:** In this phase, each sentence spoken by the user is analyzed and tagged with relevant communication skills by the SOPHIE project. While this preprocessing is crucial, it is outside the direct functionality of the SOPHIE Feedback system.

- **Feedback Delivery (Primary Function of SOPHIE Feedback System):**
  Once the preprocessing phases are complete, the SOPHIE Feedback system takes over to efficiently deliver the results:
  1. **Interactive Flask Webpage:** This output provides an interactive overview of the user's performance, highlighting areas of strength and those needing improvement.
  2. **Detailed PDF Report:** The system generates a comprehensive report detailing the user's conversational skills, with specific feedback tailored to their performance.

*The SOPHIE project is a research initiative developed within the University of Rochester's ROC-HCI Lab.*
