Sophie Hallman: Hi, doctor. I'm meeting with you today to help get some questions answered about my condition.
Sophie Hallman: I understand that I have lung cancer and that it has spread to my bones. I'm having a lot of pain in my chest and I'm currently taking lortab to help manage that pain.
Dr. Benjamin Kane: I am really sorry about your pain, SOPHIE. We can try putting you on a higher dose of the pain medication.
Sophie Hallman: That would be great.
Dr. Benjamin Kane: About your cancer. Unfortunately, it seems like the size has not decreased like we had hoped.
Sophie Hallman: Is that bad?
Dr. Benjamin Kane: Yes, SOPHIE. It does not seem like you are going to be able to beat it.
Sophie Hallman: What does that mean?
Dr. Benjamin Kane: It means that you are not going to make it.
Sophie Hallman: What are my options?
Dr. Benjamin Kane: What are your goals at this point?
Sophie Hallman: I want to be able to watch my grandson graduate.
Dr. Benjamin Kane: When does he graduate?
Sophie Hallman: In a few weeks.
Dr. Benjamin Kane: I think you will definitely be able to watch your grandson graduate, SOPHIE. Most likely, we are looking at a matter of months. Maybe up to a year.
Sophie Hallman: That's great news, doctor.
Dr. Benjamin Kane: I am glad it brings you some comfort. How can we help you be happy for the time you have left?
Sophie Hallman: I don't know. I'm just not ready to talk about my condition anymore.
Dr. Benjamin Kane: That is fine. I know it is a lot to process. Perhaps we can schedule a follow up meeting?
Sophie Hallman: That would be great.
Dr. Benjamin Kane: Okay, sounds good. Goodbye for now, SOPHIE.
Sophie Hallman: Thank you for meeting with me today. Bye.
