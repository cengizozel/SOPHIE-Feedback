I'd like to discuss your Medical Situation with you, OK?
Is there anyone else you'd like to join this conversation?
What do you understand about your medical situation?
May I share my understanding?
Do you like the basics or the details?
I've just shared a lot of information with you; what do you understand now?
Now that you understand the Medical Situation, let's explore your Values, OK? (agenda-setting)
Given what's going on medically, what are your hopes? Worries? Fears?
Who are your people? Your supports?
When you think about dying, what concerns you?
Does faith, religion, or spirituality play a role in your life?
What questions do you have?
Are there things you want to avoid?
May I make a recommendation?
Does this make sense?
