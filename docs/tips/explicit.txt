I'm afraid I have some bad news.
You have widespread and aggressive cancer.
You have suffered severe and irreversible lung damage.
The treatment is not working; the cancer is spreading.
You want us to do everything possible to live longer, even if it is uncomfortable and keeps you in the ICU. Right?
Would you want to be kept alive with a machine to help you breathe?
You want to be out of the hospital from here forward, and focus all efforts on your well-being at home, until you die.
Given what you've told me, I recommend that we take a break now, and pick up this tough conversation later.
Would you like to revisit the Medical situation to clarify your question about your prognosis?
It sounds like you've heard enough for today. How about if we resume this conversation tomorrow?
I'm concerned that your wish for X will compromise your preference for Y. So I would like to revisit your Values in this tough medical situation, okay?
