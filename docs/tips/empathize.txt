I can see this is hard to hear.
I can only imagine how upsetting this is.
Can you tell me how you're feeling about this tough news?
You're right, this sucks.
I wish I had a treatment that worked.
I hear that you want me to focus on the facts, not your emotions. I can do that.
I wish we had the cure you so want and deserve.
Your values clearly reflect your love for your kids. They are lucky to have you in their lives.
Yes, you are between a rock and a hard place.
You are managing this unbearable situation with such grace!
It is such an honor to know and work with you.
You are handling this impossible situation with impressive clarity, kindness, and wisdom.
I am with you.
