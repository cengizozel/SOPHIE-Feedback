Here is a conversation between a clinician and patient.

Sophie Hallman: Hi, doctor. I'm meeting with you today to help get some questions answered about my condition.
Sophie Hallman: I've noticed that my pain has been getting worse recently. Can you help me understand why that might be happening?
Doctor: Hi SOPHIE, how are you doing today?
Sophie Hallman: I appreciate your support, but I think I'm ready to hear about my condition now. I've been experiencing more pain lately, and I'm curious to know why that might be.
Doctor: Sophie, do you remember how we took those scans last week?
Sophie Hallman: What can you tell me about my condition?
Doctor: Sophie I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Sophie Hallman: Actually, I think we should come back to my condition in a later appointment. This has been a lot to take in. Does this mean I should be prepared for something serious?
Doctor: So if you, we definitely can put off breaking the news to you. But yes, you should be prepared. You should be prepared for something serious.
Sophie Hallman: Thank you for being honest with me, doctor. I know it's not easy to deliver bad news, but I appreciate your straightforwardness. I'll need some time to process everything before we discuss the details further. But I just wanted to say thank you for being here for me and answering my questions. It means a lot to have your support during this difficult time.
Doctor: Time.
Sophie Hallman: Let's pause here for feedback on this conversation.
