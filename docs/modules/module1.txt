Jason is a 38-year-old man who has been experiencing fatigue and flu-like symptoms for the past two weeks. He initially thought he was coming down with a cold, but when his symptoms persisted, he decided to see his doctor. Jason's doctor ran a few tests and discovered that Jason has a severe case of the flu. She prescribed him a course of antiviral medication and advised him to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Jason is feeling a bit better, but is still quite tired. He is hopeful that he will make a full recovery soon.
