LISSA:  HI, MY NAME IS SOPHIE. IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS , I WAS GIVEN A CT SCAN TO FIGURE HOW FAR MY CANCER HAS PROGRESSED . I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS ARE AND WHAT THEY MEAN FOR MY FUTURE .
LISSA:  TRUTH BE TOLD, I'VE ALREADY SCANNED THE RESULTS, BUT DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE TELLING ME. IT ALL SEEMS VERY COMPLICATED . COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THEY MEAN ?
Subject: are the test results on good Sophie they show that your cancer has spread past the sized and they would likely kill you within a year
LISSA:  THOSE ARE NOT THE WORDS I WANTED TO HEAR . I MEAN, I WAS BRACING FOR THE WORST, SINCE I COULD TELL BY THE PAIN THAT IT'S BAD . BUT TO HEAR THAT THE CANCER HAS SPREAD IS QUITE DEPRESSING . WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN FOR ME ?
Subject: well Sophie it's it's not good I can tell you that you're going to need
LISSA:  I GUESS IT'S NOT EASY TO SAY FOR SURE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE FULLY PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE THOUGH .
LISSA:  I WANT YOU TO BE HONEST WITH ME . HOW LONG DO YOU THINK I HAVE LEFT ?
Subject: maybe a year
LISSA:  THAT'S DIFFICULT TO HEAR . ARE YOU CERTAIN I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME THAN A YEAR ? I HAD AN UNCLE FRED WHO WAS TOLD HE HAD TWO OR THREE MONTHS TO LIVE , BUT HE HELD ON FOR A YEAR AND A HALF .
Subject: well that's miraculous I expect it won't happen to you though
LISSA:  I'VE HEARD HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO PREDICT THESE THINGS . ALL THE SAME , FOR SOMEONE WITH SUCH A BLEAK PROGNOSIS, I'M ACTUALLY FEELING PRETTY GREAT . IS THERE A CHANCE I MAY BE ABLE TO BEAT THIS ?
Subject: is very unlikely Sophie
LISSA:  OH . THAT'S UNFORTUNATE . STILL , I HOPE I CAN KEEP THIS GOOD HEALTH AS LONG AS I'M ABLE AND USE IT TO SPEND TIME WITH MY FAMILY .
LISSA:  I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HAPPENED! JUST THREE MONTHS AGO I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I HAD CANCER.
Subject: yep well you smoked a bunch and that caused your death well it will cause your death
LISSA:  I HAVEN'T TOLD MY FAMILY EVERYTHING YET . I WANTED TO WAIT TO TALK TO YOU FIRST . WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO THEM ?
Subject: I mean you should tell them that you're going to die soon and they need to say goodbye
LISSA:  OKAY. IT WILL BE DIFFICULT, BUT MY FAMILY AND I WILL HAVE TO BE STRONG .
LISSA:  THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH ME TODAY. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TALK ABOUT MY FUTURE, BUT COMFORTING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT MY OPTIONS. YOU'VE GIVEN ME A LOT TO THINK ABOUT AND TO DISCUSS WITH MY FAMILY. GOODBYE.
